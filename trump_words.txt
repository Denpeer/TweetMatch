Higher tariffs (taxes) means more poverty and fewer jobs..@HillaryClinton, everything you say adds to the debt #debate"Investments" (n): Bigger government from @HillaryClinton #DebateDictionaryThe isolationism of @realDonaldTrump is stunning. "Going our own way" on trade means more taxes on you and me."Regime"? The presidency is now a "regime"? Yikes.We have our first agreement of the night! More debt! The @realDonaldTrump plan =$10T more the @HillaryClinton plan=$20T more #debateSupport #smallbusiness AND raise the #minimumwage... that's definitely a contradiction in terms. #debateWhen you bring certainty that taxes will not go up, that rules and regs won't become worse, #jobs will increase. #debateWe have bombed seven Muslim countries in the last year. It doesn't appear that'll change with these two. #debate(And release your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump)Being President is an incredible responsibility and honor. It requires #transparency. Release the speeches, @HillaryClinton. #debatesWe would have more context on @HillaryClinton's @GoldmanSachs speeches if we didn't have to rely on @wikileaks. She can solve that problem!#Debate note: apparently, @realDonaldTrump is upset that @POTUS didn't break up more families and deport more undocumented workers.Make it as easy as possible to get a work visa that would entail a background check and a SSN card (so taxes are paid). #debateIf @HillaryClinton + her party wanted to solve immigration problems, they could have done it when they controlled government. They didn't.Let's build economic bridges to #Mexico, not walls. #debateIf there's one country we should build ties to, it's #Mexico. Let's build diplomatic and economic strength with #Mexico, not a wall.Don't build a wall across the border. It's insanity. #debateThe law of the land is Casey v. #PlannedParenthood. Not Roe v. Wade. #debateOf note, @alangura who argued on behalf of #Heller before #SCOTUS has endorsed our ticket. #debate #2A.@HillaryClinton supports #2A...except with respect to gun registries, private transfers, when the government doesn't want u 2 have a gun...The #SCOTUS nominee needs to make decisions based on the original intent of the #Constitution. That will limit the scope of the government..@JonathanTurley and former congressman Tom Campbell would be my potential appointments to the #SupremeCourt. #debate #SCOTUSI'm live tweeting the #debate from @JimmyKimmelLive and then appearing on "After the Debate."

https://t.co/qgGpiEEuZbMy statement reacting to tonight's debate: https://t.co/lYq27JykshFiscally responsible. Socially inclusive. Keep America safe. And honest. That's @govbillweld and me. #debateWe have too much work to do for our country to be distracted with these scandal-plagued candidates. America can do better. #debateOur campaign has raised $10M, the vast majority from small donors. We're the campaign that's not for sale. #debate#Tariffs are #taxes that you and I pay. #debate#Freetrade means on net more #jobs and lower prices for American families. #debateThe civil war in Syria is heart-breaking. W/o strong diplomacy, Hillary's safe zone ineffective and would require U.S. boots on the ground..@hillaryclinton is explaining her $1.5T tax increase. Hopefully, @realdonaldtrump will have to explain his trillions of deficit spending.If you're tired of this now, imagine what four years of this would be like.
America can do better. #debateBack to fighting about scandals. We started with #sexualassault and emails. Now we're to #Wikileaks and tax returns. America can do better.The unforgivable in life is #hypocrisy: doing one thing and saying another. You are guilty of hypocrisy when it comes to Wall Street HillaryThe deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants is WRONG. Issue work visas. #debate.@HillaryClinton thinks we're safer with #regimechange despite Libya, Iraq, Syria.@realDonaldTrump thinks we're safer by violating the #Constitution and imposing religious bans. #debateBring competition to #healthcare! A #freemarket approach is needed, and recognize that healthcare is far removed from the free market.I did not think that #debate number 2 could be more pathetic than debate number 1 and yet to this point, it is.23 minutes in, and we still have had no serious discussion about #jobs, #debt, or our security. #debateGot to agree to with @HillaryClinton, he doesn't apologize for anything. #debateAn apology does not include shifting this to Bill Clinton. #debateI'll be tweeting during the #debate.

You can't run a governme... https://t.co/kEHYj4KBYwWe now must take on a horrific Republican budget and efforts at "tax reform" which means huge tax breaks to billionaires and corporations.We must be clear. This important victory against the Republican health care plan is not the end of our work. It is the beginning.This is a major victory for working families and everyone who attended rallies and town hall meetings in opposition... https://t.co/ZjsUxhdLRlOur true goal is not just stopping Republicans from destroying health care. Our goal is guaranteeing health care as a right to all people.Republicans are scrambling on their health care plan and they are embarrassed. They're on the defensive. Keep fighting back.Republicans' health care plan--tax breaks for millionaires and raised premiums for seniors--isn't what a civilized society is about.Trump promised "insurance for everybody." Apparently "everybody" doesn't include the 24 million they are taking health care away from.How does it happen that we have a president who has nothing but nice things to say about Mr. Putin? What do the Russians have on Mr. Trump?Trump's war against truth https://t.co/tk6h57WbB0We must never forget. Health care is a human right. All people are entitled to coverage.We should call the Republican health care plan what it really is: a massive tax break for those who are the wealthiest in America.Let us never forget that in 2008, Wall Street's greed, recklessness and illegal behavior nearly destroyed our economyWhen Wall Street talks, Congress listens. When working class kids talk about being saddled with horrendous debts, who is listening to them?We're the richest nation in history. And yet 1 in 4 Americans have to choose between medicine or other necessities like food.Some politicians still refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. It's 2017. That's a disgrace.The U.S. has the largest defense budget in the world--bigger than the next 12 nations combined. But Trump wants more.
https://t.co/J0S6e95hc9Trump and the rest of the Republican party are turning their backs on working and rural Americans and seniors.
https://t.co/GnuE47zqi7Our job is to stand together and say: we don't need to give tax breaks to billionaires. We need to invest in working people.For someone who talked about draining the swamp and standing up to Wall Street, Trump has a funny way of doing so.
https://t.co/RLEAWSV3wvBeing involved in politics is not just about elections. It is fighting for racial, social, economic and environmental justice every day.We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.The great political and democratic crisis we now face is not voter fraud. It is voter suppression.Amidst Trump's antics we must not lose sight of a progressive agenda focused on racial, social, environmental and economic justice.For someone who talked about draining the swamp and standing up to Wall Street, Trump has a funny way of doing so. https://t.co/RLEAWSDs7VHere's a radical idea. Let's make our economy work for all of us, not just the top 1%.We must guarantee health care as a right. People who can't afford care deserve to live as much as those who can.The GOP alternative to Obamacare is grotesque and ugly. You don't throw 24 million people off health care and call it "health care reform."The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies and get the health care they choose. No cuts to Planned Parenthood.Our job is to provide health care for all people as a human right, not throw 24 million Americans off the health insurance that they have.If Donald Trump and Paul Ryan's "health care" plan is adopted, thousands of Americans will die. This bill is a disgrace.The @ACLU at this critical time is doing enormously important work. I congratulate them for stepping up to the chal... https://t.co/d20HUJBXanThe wealthy don't deserve health care more than anyone else. Everyone should be guaranteed health care regardless of their income.I've been criticized for this point, so allow me to repeat it: health care is a human right of all people, not a privilege.Remember: the U.S. is the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people. That's what we have to do.We spend far, far more per capita for our very dysfunctional health care system. Republicans want to make that worse.The Republican "substitute" for Obamacare is not really health care legislation. Its primary purpose is to provide tax breaks to the rich.Trump Should Avoid a Bad Zika Deal https://t.co/jzhp4093z3Because we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations. https://t.co/JNdu2VFovWTrump's Muslim ban isn't about keeping us safe. A president intent on keeping us safe wouldn't give ideological ammunition to terrorists.Let's call Trump's travel ban what it is: A racist and anti-Islamic attempt to divide us up.I am proud to stand with everyone today who is fighting for dignity on the job and the right to join a union at Nissan.We need a Justice Department that will give us the facts about Russia's ties to the Trump campaign. Jeff Sessions should resign.Thank you President Trump and Mr. Bannon for making our country less safe. https://t.co/uEDzDsyQQ2Trump must speak against this senseless act, not just condemn violence when it fits his agenda of fear mongering. https://t.co/cTsLG5aTm4If the Republicans in Congress won't do the right thing for workers, we must advance the progressive agenda state by state.The attacks against transgender people are part of a bigotry which has got to end.To Republicans I say: Do your job. Listen to your constituents. They do not want Obamacare repealed and to be thrown off their health care.Americans should not have to pay the highest prices for prescription drugs simply because Congress is bought and paid for by Big Pharma.More and more Americans are getting involved in the political process and are standing up and fighting back. https://t.co/i61Gz8yNoWThe Democratic Party must make clear it will stand up to the 1% and lead in the fight for social, racial, economic and environmental justiceIt's imperative Tom understands that the same-old, same-old isn't working and that we must bring in working and young people in a new way.I congratulate Tom Perez on his election as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and look forward to working with him.Now is the time for the American people to demand that the Congress listens to them, and not wealthy campaign contributors or lobbyists.I believe you are entitled to justice and to equal rights, whether you're black, Hispanic, gay or transgender. You are a human being.One of the great and ongoing struggles of human existence has been the effort to overcome fear of people who are different than we are.How is it that there are people who have more luxuries than anyone can imagine, while children go hungry or die of preventable diseases?It is time to understand that health care is a right, not a privilege. It is time to move toward a Medicare-for-all system.Ed Garvey will be sorely missed, but not forgotten. He was an inspiration to many of us. https://t.co/uj878F8JLKWhen we talk about fair wages, I hope every man will stand with women and fight for pay equity.We have virtually no voter fraud in America. What is the fraud is that people are changing laws because of so-called voter fraud.We will lose our fights for justice when we are divided or apathetic, and the fights we face now are far too important to risk that.We will not allow Republicans to punish the elderly, children, the sick and the poor, while they reward their billionaire friends.At a time of grotesque income inequality, the rich do not need more tax breaks and working people do not need cuts to basic needs.This is no time for despair or giving up. This is a time for organizing, educating and fighting back.The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.Obamacare isn't perfect. But the solution is not to throw millions off health care without a replacement plan and say, "You're on your own."When Trump and his friends make delusional statements about "voter fraud," they are setting the stage for an increase in voter suppression.Our job today: strengthen Obamacare and stop the repeal. Tomorrow, we must join the rest of the world and guarantee health care for all.If you're rich and powerful and commit illegal behavior you get promoted to the president's cabinet. There's something very wrong with that.Our nation worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't believe that is the nation we should be living in.It appears Mr. Trump, who attacks media that makes critical remarks about him as "fake news," doesn't understand what democracy is about.Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 20 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.25 states and cities raised minimum wages last year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.Our diversity is our strength. We must take pride in that, not let hatred divide us.I would hope that Republicans have the courage to stand up to Trump's movement to authoritarianism.Trump: Want to know what fake news is? Your denial of climate change and the lies spread by fossil fuel companies to protect their profits.According to Trump, if you want the truth, ignore everything except what he is saying. That's what totalitarianism... https://t.co/JVntCuATsPGreat news! Now is the time for Keith Ellison to become chair of the Democratic Party. https://t.co/471e8OB6xqInstead of draining the swamp, Trump is filling it up with the same old Wall Street insiders, whose greed nearly destroyed our economy.Talk about cowardice. Republicans are trying to ram through Pruitt's confirmation before the American people find out what is in his emails.We need an EPA administrator whose priority is the safety of people, not the profits of the fossil fuel industry. Pruitt is not that person.Scientists are virtually unanimous that climate change is real and caused by human activity. Mr. Pruitt refuses to recognize that.We need a Labor Secretary who will stand up for workers, raising the minimum wage &amp; pay equity for women. Mr. Puzder was not that candidate.We need to know if President Trump's foreign policy represents the best interests of this country or the best interests of Russia.Our job: Break up the major financial institutions, not appoint more Wall Street executives to the administration as Trump has done.Our job is to grow the trade union movement so that workers, white collar and blue collar, can stand up and fight for their rights.Trump old workers he would stand up for them and stand up to Wall Street. Now, the same old Wall Street insiders are running the show.What I say to the American people is: stay focused. We will fight for an economy that works for all and doesn't just benefit the wealthy.We've got to bring people together around a progressive agenda. They want to raise the minimum wage and make health care a right.Trump is a total hypocrite. He campaigned saying I'm going to take on Wall Street, and then he hires the president of Goldman Sachs.When Donald Trump attacks the  media as "fake news" what he is doing is trying to move our country in an authoritarian direction.Our job is to stand together, vigorously oppose Trump's racist immigration policies and fight for policies that work for working families.Whether it is in conservative parts of the country or in progressive areas, the American people are fighting back. https://t.co/xIhj3j0MbMTrump has sent many tweets the last few months. But where's the tweet saying he'll keep his promise to not cut Medicare and Medicaid?We need an Attorney General who'll defend the Constitution &amp; educate the president about what it means. Jeff Sessions won't be that person.When I read the same letter as @SenWarren, no one prevented me from speaking. Sen. McConnell owes Sen. Warren an apology. #LetLizSpeakIt is unconscionable that Sen. Mitch McConnell silenced Sen. Elizabeth Warren because she read a letter from Coretta Scott King.CEOs of drug companies should not be making millions when customers are dying because they cannot afford their medication. #DebateWithBernieIn the midst of massive wealth inequality, @tedcruz doesn't just want to take away health care, he wants to give huge tax breaks to the 1%.We're having an absurd discussion for the wealthiest nation. We are talking about taking health care away from 30 million people.A Medicare-for-all system would save us hundreds of billions in health care costs a year. It's financially smart and the moral thing to do.I've been criticized for this point, so allow me to repeat it: Yes, health care is a right of all people. #DebateWithBernie#DebateWithBernie https://t.co/2Spnjrr61MPresident Trump and the Army have chosen to ignore the law and allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to be completed. Th... https://t.co/DxwtaYBfeoAre we really comfortable with a situation where private companies and the government know more about our lives tha... https://t.co/EpjcK0694GDonald Trump's goal is to protect the interests of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country. That is exactly what he's doing.After working for Puzder for 21 years, JoAnn left without a penny of savings, with no health care and no pension. https://t.co/e49TlD2XfASen. Sanders will debate Sen. Ted Cruz tonight on the future of the Affordable Care Act. Tune in at 9 ET!... https://t.co/xepdDv1r6iThe choice on DeVos is clear. We need to protect children with disabilities, not ignore their needs. #NoOnDeVosWhen Republicans say they want to "save" or "strengthen" Social Security, what they mean is that they want to cut Social Security benefits.Donald Trump is a fraud. He said during the campaign he would take on Wall Street and now he's working for Wall Street.Surprise, surprise. Trump has turned his back on everything he said in the campaign and cozied up to Wall Street. https://t.co/vbvGsjUJOCI want a Supreme Court that will stand up for civil liberties, constitutional rights, workers' rights, environmental rights, women's rights.We are a democracy, not a one-man show. We are not another Trump enterprise.Friday's order by a federal judge in Seattle blocking President Trump's immigration ban was a victory for rule of law and the Constitution.It is not only progressives who are outraged by Trump's actions and statements. https://t.co/PvYlgJAtK7This absurd and unconstitutional idea must not be passed. We must not end the separation of church and state. https://t.co/3InVIwiigTIs there not one more Republican senator who will stand with the American people against Betsy DeVos?Judge Gorsuch must explain his hostility to women's rights, support of corporations over workers and opposition to... https://t.co/0ysIP2LVl4President Trump's ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries is un-American, unconstitutional and will not make us more safe.The American people are settling in for a long and sustained fight to defend democracy and the values which have made us a great county.We believe in a nation based on economic, social, racial and environmental justice and we've just begun to fight back.We should be looking for guidance now not from pollsters and political consultants, but from leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr.Given Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional actions, the Democratic Party can no longer do politics "as usual."Putting Steve Bannon, an extreme right-wing operative, on the National Security Council is dangerous and he should be removed.We say to @realDonaldTrump: Rescind the Muslim ban!The American people want real change, a change based on compassion and justice, not hatred, intolerance and divisiveness.Republicans say they want to get government off people's backs, except, of course, if you are a woman who wants to control her own body.Trump claimed he would stand up for working people, but it turns out Goldman Sachs is still running the show.
https://t.co/w6jRqp0DpCWe're the only major country that doesn't guarantee health care for all as a right. Yet, we also spend far more per capita on health care.We need a qualified and knowledgable Education Secretary, not a billionaire who contributed hundreds of millions to right-wing Republicans.Is Trump already in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution? https://t.co/uVqKGsQCIgCongress and the American people must defend American values. No torture!The great political and democratic crisis we now face is not voter fraud. It doesn't exist. It is voter suppression.President Trump said the other day that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the election. That's delusional, an "alternative fact."I will do everything I can to stop these pipelines and protect our planet for future generations. https://t.co/W18GzYr0tIThank you @lsarsour for helping to organize the march and build a progressive movement. When we stand together, we win. #IMarchwithLindaWe must be vigorous in fighting terrorism, but we can do it in a way that is constitutional and respects our freedom and privacy rights.It'd be funny if it wasn't so absurd: Trump, a billionaire, surrounded at his inauguration by billionaires, says he's anti-establishment.If the ACA is repealed, researchers tell us that 43,000 Americans could die. That's beyond comprehension. https://t.co/E4lqfWnTg3If Mr. Trump is serious about standing up for working families, he won't throw 20 million working people off of health insurance.Republicans want to repeal the ACA, but their alternative (if they ever come up with one) will likely be much worse. https://t.co/F28Iur0W7tThe simple truth is that we'll never have the health care system we need if private insurance companies and drug companies run the show.President Trump: Women aren't going back to second-class citizenship. They are going forward. We are all in this together.We won't achieve our goals if we treat democracy as a spectator sport, hoping others will do it. They won't. The future is in our hands.We must vigorously defend DACA and the young people in that program and fight for immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.Our response to Mr. Trump's inauguration has to be to fight back for economic, social, environmental &amp; racial justice. We're not giving up!There should be no disagreement that the First Family represented us with extraordinary dignity, grace and civility over the last 8 years.If Republicans think they're simply going to throw millions off of health insurance, they've got another thing coming.Let us not forget where Dr. King was when he was assassinated. He was standing up with exploited workers in Memphis, Tennessee. #MLKDay"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed." - MLKTo the tens of thousands who stood up for #OurFirstStand, thank you.

Today we defend that right. #OurFirstStandReal change always takes place from the bottom on up. Real change happens when people come together to demand it.... https://t.co/EwJ9TcPSHFRepublicans in Congress need to worry about millions of people who are standing up and fighting back to defend health care. #OurFirstStandWe are saying to our Republican colleagues: we will not let you throw up to 30 million Americans off of health insurance. #OurFirstStandOur job today is defend the Affordable Care Act. Our job tomorrow is to create a single-payer system. #OurFirstStandBernie is speaking now in Warren, MI #OurFirstStand https://t.co/g2znaFzIa2From Hawai'i to Maine, thousands of people say to Republicans today: "You won't get away with dismantling our health care." #OurFirstStandWe will not stand by and watch our health care be dismantled.

Find a rally near you: https://t.co/0gzurtl5gFWhen millions of people stand together we win. Take a stand today to protect health care for all. https://t.co/oVtr4LCpHVHow can Republicans end the Affordable Care Act without having a replacement? We must not allow that to happen. https://t.co/JBXEH2KANv.@SenateDems unanimously opposed Republicans' plan to take away health care. Tomorrow, all of us must stand united. https://t.co/oVtr4LkOjlIn the middle of the night Republicans took step 1 toward taking health care from 30 million people. Fight back! https://t.co/oVtr4LCpHVLiterally, there are thousands of people who die every single year because they cannot afford the medicine they need. That's outrageous.Take a stand Jan. 15 to save health care from Republican attempts to throw 30 million people off health insurance. https://t.co/oVtr4LCpHVWe must never forget. Health care is a human right. All people are entitled to coverage.We will not allow Republicans to punish the elderly, children, the sick and the poor, while they reward their billionaire friends.On January 15, join a day of action to stand up to Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress and save health care. https://t.co/oVtr4LCpHVWe should be working to make health care a right not debating whether to take health care away from Americans. https://t.co/A3ywFOD1m8Tell @GOP: You aren't going to take away our health care while you reward your billionaire friends. #OurFirstStand https://t.co/7CHHd8bm4XThere is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.While we attack grotesque levels of income inequality in this country, we must simultaneously address the structural racism so many endure.When folks stand together against a rigged system, they can forge a politics that can transform a city, a nation, and maybe the world.We cannot stay silent and watch the GOP dismantle the health care system and jeopardize the economic security of millions of Americans.Some politicians still refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. It's 2017. That's a disgrace.It's simple, really: Politicians should be working for their constituents' votes, not lobbyists' money. That's not radical. It's democracy.Are we comfortable as a nation to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever?After all the progress we've made on women's rights, we can't go back to the days when women didn't have the right to control their bodies.The right wing in this country is waging a war against women, but let me be very clear: This is not a war we are going to allow them to win.New tax breaks for the rich and big corporations may be popular in country clubs, but it's way out of touch with what most Americans want.We must join every other major country &amp; guarantee health care for all, not throw millions of women off excellent health care. #StandWithPPWe should not be debating whether to take health care away from 30 million people. We should be working to make health care a right for all..@SenateGOP How do you go forward giving a death penalty to thousands of people by taking their health care away without any solution?You don't throw 30 millions people off health care without having a plan to provide health care to those people.We can't stay silent and watch Republicans dismantle our health care system and jeopardize the economic security of millions of Americans.Our message to Mr. Trump is simple: We are not going backwards. You will not divide us up by race, nationality, gender or sexual orientationIn the year 2017, we should be encouraging our people to get the best education they can, not punishing them with a mountain of debt.If we are serious about having the best-educated workforce in the world, we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.It is unconscionable that millions of people in the world's richest country are one diagnosis or car accident away from financial disaster.We will lose our fights for justice when we are divided or apathetic, and the fights coming this year are far too important to risk that.Congress has got to protect and expand the health care needs of working families, not cut them.Stopping the Republican assault on the working class will require the active participation of millions of Americans in every community.The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.We won't let Republicans punish the elderly, children, sick and poor while they reward their billionaire friends. https://t.co/aBgGnSd3aoWe've seen the surefire route to success in politics has been to manipulate people's fear and ignorance. We can and will change that.We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.Working people are angry and they have a right to be angry. This economy isn't for them--it's for the extremely wealthy.Republicans are not going to get away with punishing the poor while rewarding their billionaire friends.When we fight we're fighting for the future--the future of the planet in terms of climate change, and for the future of American democracy.Happy New Year! Never forget greed is powerful but our vision of a world based on economic, social &amp; environmental justice is more powerful.Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible.The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country. That should not be the case when people's lives are at stake.Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 30 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.Cities and towns and states have stepped up and raised the minimum wage to $15. It's about time that Congress does the same for all workers.You cannot be a party which takes money from Wall Street and then tells working families you are on their side. People see through that.The U.S. shouldn't discourage kids who want to go to college with massive costs. We should be educating as many people as we possibly can.Our goal must be to improve the VA, not destroy it. We will vigorously oppose any and all efforts to privatize the VA.While other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right, we spend more on our military than the next seven nations combined.I wish elected officials would spend less time making it harder for people to vote and more time fighting for the working class.Members of Congress spend way too much time in pursuit of money and too little time actually debating the issues.Here's a radical idea.  Let's create an economy that works for the bottom 99%, not just the people on top.My nightmare is our grandchildren wondering why we did not leave them a planet that is habitable.25 states and cities raised minimum wages this year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.It doesn't make sense to trust billionaires to fight for the working class. The billionaire agenda is not the agenda of the American people.If we claim to be the greatest nation on Earth, then we've got to catch up to other major countries and guarantee health care for all.The EPA needs a leader who will actually protect the environment, not a climate denier like Trump's choice Scott Pruitt.We have accomplished too much as a country to see our progress washed away by leaders who are fearful, hateful and misinformed.It really is frightening when you have a party controlling the House, Senate and presidency and saying "You know what? We reject science."One of the most revolting aspects of the student loan crisis is that the government makes billions in profits off of student loans.A $15 minimum wage was very recently considered too radical. But when people see the justice of an idea, it catches fire very quickly.It's an international embarrassment that we imprison more people than any other country on earth.People should not have to choose between medicine and groceries. And yet the greed of the drug industry makes that happen every day.People who want to limit carbon emissions:

So much for draining the swamp...Mr. Trump and his friends should know there are millions of people who will not stand for their greed at the expense of the working class.While tens of millions of children around the world go hungry and uneducated, a handful of billionaires divide up the riches of the planet.Democrats must start playing ball in states that we have conceded decades ago, where people are now being left out of the political process.The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies, not politicians.For decades, Republicans and Democrats have understood that the goal must be to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, not expand them.We must stand with our brothers and sisters in NC who despite the GOP power grab are bravely fighting for economic, racial &amp; social justice.My parents' dream was that if they worked hard as parents, they'd see their kids go to college.

Neither is taking action to save the planet.Garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a clear example of why we need fundamental changes in our national prioritiesIt is beyond absurd that so many bright young people are unable to attend college because of the cost.We are moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and it will take all of us to fight against it.Clinton received almost 3 million more votes, but Trump will be the next president. It's clear the electoral college needs to be changed.Lowering prices on prescription drugs--that is, making sure that people can afford to live--should not be a partisan issue.Every person in this country deserves a decent opportunity and a decent standard of living. Until that happens we will not truly be free.It would be nice to put off worrying about climate change for a few decades. But the truth is we have no choice but to act now.We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.Cuts to life and death programs like Medicare and massive tax breaks for the wealthy--that's not what America is supposed to be about.Even though the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost 4x more likely to be arrested for possession.Walmart costs taxpayers $6.2 billion every year in public assistance programs by not paying their workers a living wage. That is insane.Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who do not want cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.Our job is to grow the union movement so that anyone working 40 hours a week, whether it's in a factory or a hotel, doesn't live in poverty.A small subsection of the one percent are hell-bent on doing everything in their power to block action against climate change.Young people in this country should be in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells.There is hatred being generated against immigrants in this country.

It`s going to come from grassroots America.As a result of bad trade agreements like NAFTA, we have lost over 4 million decent paying manufacturing jobs.This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Our job: abolish poverty, not let 130,000 people die every year because of it.Men in the wealthiest counties in this country live 18 years longer than men in the poorest counties.Poverty in America is a death sentence. Wealthy women live 12 years longer than lower income women.If current trends continue, one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison. This is an outrage.We must end the "war on drugs," which has destroyed lives and disproportionately impacted people of color.Instead of frightening 11 million undocumented people with deportation, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship.We must end private prisons and detention centers in the U.S. The time is long overdue for real criminal justice reform.Cities and towns and states have raised the minimum wage to $15. It's time that Congress steps up to give all people a living wage.I don't know how many times I have to say it, but I'll keep saying it until it happens: all people should have a right to health care.Maybe, just maybe, we want to pass legislation to make the wealthy start paying their fair share in taxes before we start slashing Medicare.Does @realDonaldTrump have the guts to stand up to House Republicans who want to slash Social Security?Millions of seniors, disabled vets and people with disabilities can't get by on $11,000 or less. We must expand Social Security, not cut it.Donald Trump is a pathological liar.  We need the help of the American people to build a movement of millions who are following reality.Everyone who voted for Trump, who thought he'd defend working people, pay attention to the reality of what he's doing not just his rhetoric.Mr. Trump should not be attacking strong and effective union leaders like Chuck Jones. https://t.co/XBA3VGTWPX.@realDonaldTrump rather than attacking effective union leaders like Chuck Jones, why don't you work with them to c... https://t.co/PWMZw1kNk8Trump's choice to lead EPA doesn't just deny climate change, he's worked with oil &amp; gas companies to make us more dependent on fossil fuels.The fight for $15 has proven to the world that when people stand together and fight for... https://t.co/1nZT8cFKSb$10.10 isn't good enough. $12 isn't good enough. We won't rest until every worker is paid at least $15 an hour and can form a union.The top 10 pharmaceutical executives received over $327 million last year, while 1 in 5 Americans can't afford to fill their prescriptions.Hundreds of thousands of seniors are forced to cut their pills in half because the medicine they need is too expensive.Trump's reactionary agenda won't be defeated in Congress. It will be defeated when millions of Americans come together to oppose xenophobia.Our job now is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels, not to produce more greenhouse gas emissions.In the year 2016, we should not continue to trample on Native American sovereignty or become more dependent on fossil fuel.I appreciate @POTUS listening to the Native Americans and millions of others who believe the Dakota Access Pipeline shouldn't be built.Trump attacked Wall Street on the campaign. Now he nominates a former Goldman Sachs executive to be Treasury secretary. What hypocrisy!America remains the only major country not to guarantee health care for all. The Republican response: throw millions off health insurance.Trump's focus should not be a few people who might burn the American flag. It should be on working families and combatting climate change.If Trump is serious about helping the middle class, we'll work with him. So far, it's clear he doesn't give a damn about working families.Donald Trump wants to treat corporate greed with kid gloves. If he won't stand up for America's working class, we must.Carrier gets millions in tax breaks. Indiana loses thousands of jobs.

It's that simple. https://t.co/r59b9HlcrLEarthquakes like those in Oklahoma are just one of fracking's effects we must fight to keep out of N. Dakota #noDAPL https://t.co/Erd0HaXbUdFights like #noDAPL have long-term consequence. It is a fight for the type of planet our children will inhabit. https://t.co/PHM9vRHdDjTwo-thirds of Americans want to eliminate the offshore tax haven loophole. It's time for Congress to stand with them, not big corporations.Robert Reich is right. It's about time Congress shut the loopholes corporations use to hide the billions they owe. https://t.co/ETQbTDSo82Mylan thinks we should just accept their price gouging and greed as normal. It isn't normal. It's an outrage. https://t.co/hw5codV7vvMost major nations negotiate with drug companies on their citizens' behalf to keep costs down. Our government should be able to do the same.The future of prescription costs in America comes down to this: Do we have the guts to stand up to drug companies who are ripping us off?The epidemic of price gouging in the drug industry is obscene. Their greed is putting millions of lives at risk. https://t.co/BeFM2IStJKThe need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive or conservative issue. It is an American issue. https://t.co/j5y0Y6Qp8dBillionaires like the Kochs spend millions to elect anti-union officials because they know when unions suffer, all workers' wages go down.Unions are my family. Standing with workers on picket lines is something I've done my entire life-- that's what I do and what I believe.We need a strong union movement to rebuild our middle class. When unions do well, wages rise for everyone. #LaborDay https://t.co/GtaEEph4G7Social Security, Medicare and workplace safety are just a few of the benefits we now enjoy thanks to the the struggle of unions. #LaborDayI have stood with unions all of my life and I will continue to do so in fighting the disastrous TPP.We've had enough of "free trade" deals like the TPP that benefit CEOs at the expense of workers. https://t.co/sclnvlLi6PIf we are serious about getting big money out of politics and restoring our democracy, we must move toward public funding of campaigns.The political revolution is about making sure anyone can run for office and not have to beg the rich for donations. https://t.co/abWEqMcneeWhen the vote of the poor and minorities is suppressed, it becomes that much easier for the ruling class to further rig the system.To politicians who pass laws to suppress the vote I say: Get another job. https://t.co/488Tww7HqyConsidering the planetary crisis we face, it is completely inappropriate to continue giving billions in tax breaks to fossil fuel companies.It is time to stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating its people as the U.S. citizens they are. https://t.co/3R8kKA05NHThe only honest, cost-effective approach to universal health care is a single-payer approach. https://t.co/Mk5j1p4e4qHistory will record that the Citizens United decision is one of the worst in the history of our country. https://t.co/bjh5tOKoW4Our reliance on fossil fuels isn't only disastrous for the environment, but disastrous for our financial well-being. https://t.co/u7V1Jgm19VWe must not allow Puerto Rico's budget to be balanced on the backs of the most vulnerable people - working families, children and the poor.Disappointing to hear that Puerto Rico's fiscal control board will include some of the architects of the crisis on the island. #PROMESAWealth inequality is obscenely high and workers' wages are obscenely low. We need more unions, not less. https://t.co/GtaEEoZtOzThis country needs Medicare-for-All. It's time for a more progressive health care system. https://t.co/leStBM1zH2Mylan should be ashamed for gouging the prices of such an important and life-saving drug. https://t.co/ABxs9Pe0FBWe need more unions in this country, not less. https://t.co/UzCJhI2IMPWhile 16 million kids live in poverty in this country, the rich continue to get richer. https://t.co/qRntop2Q6rThe best way to effectively and rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild this nation's infrastructure.Huge corporations can't be allowed to use loopholes and tax havens to boost their obscene profits even higher. I applaud the EU's decision.Apple's earnings in 2015 were the highest reported of any corporation in history, yet apparently that wasn't enough. https://t.co/BPiMjwsGk0.@PramilaJayapal is absolutely right. Love trumps hatred. https://t.co/dxqEiCIn4uI haven't seen a single major Wall Street executive be prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.Why is it that kids are jailed for possessing marijuana but nothing happens to Wall Street execs whose illegal behavior harmed millions?Study after study shows the same thing: women make less than men for equal work, and women of color make even less. https://t.co/a7bH0a57OvWe need rational immigration policies in America that offer a pathway to citizenship. We shouldn't be promoting divisiveness.This type of greed is shameful, and if Mylan thinks the American people are going to accept this so-called "compromise," they are mistaken.Mylan recently announced a generic version for $300. That's still five times as expensive as it was in 2007: a 526% increase in total.In 2007, when Mylan first started selling their EpiPens, they only cost $57. Last week, the price was $600. https://t.co/az4XOpQoPEThe obscene greed of Wall Street and corporate America is slowly destroying the fabric of this nation. We must stop them.Let's not be distracted.

Egregious.If hand counting of paper ballots is considered the "gold standard" of election auditing, we should do it--don't Americans deserve it?What we saw in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were recounts in name only. Americans will never know how their votes were counted.Let's institute public financing of elections, so we can get big money *out* and let people back *in* to our political system.We not only have the right to vote--we have the right to know who we can vote for.

That's unfair to voters.A judicial opinion in Wisconsin: A hand recount was the "gold standard"--but nearly 1/2 of votes were recounted by the same flawed machines.Watch my 2016 running mate @ajamubaraka + @blkagendareport's Danny Haiphong discuss Russia + Trump at 8 p.m. ET:... https://t.co/EGCwEiGWTQBecause 80% of Pennsylvanians voted on paperless, electronic voting machines ("DREs"), no paper ballots could be recounted.Do we have a voting system we can trust, that is accurate, secure and just, and free from modern-day Jim Crow in our elections? No.Together, we can build a powerful force to resist Trump and put people, planet, and peace over the interests of an entrenched elite.As Steve Grumbine of @RealProgressUS said, going after Donald Trump is low-hanging fruit.
